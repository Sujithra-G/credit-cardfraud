💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection App
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using a machine learning model (XGBoost) and provides real-time predictions through a user-friendly Streamlit web app.
We use a dataset containing anonymized transaction details, where each entry is labeled as fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0). By training machine learning models on this data, the system learns to recognize patterns that are indicative of fraud.
